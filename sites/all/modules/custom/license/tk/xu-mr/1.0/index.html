<img src="icon/120.png" alt="TK XU-MR Label Icon" />
<p><strong>TK holders:</strong> This label should be applied when the material that is being accessed by external users is traditionally sensitive sacred/secret and restricted ceremonial material. This label recognizes that within the community there are specific protocols and conditions of use and that the external user needs to respect and to enter into dialogue about the appropriate use of this material outside the community. It is a label that recognizes that some knowledge is gendered, and that certain knowledge can only be shared among specific members of the community. This is a men’s restricted label and indicates to external users that there are community-based restrictions on the access and use and that only authorized [and initiated] men within the community should be using this material.</p>
<p><strong>TK users:</strong> This material has specific gender restrictions on access. It is regarded as important secret and/or ceremonial material that has community-based customs and laws in relation to who can access it. Given its sensitive nature it is only to be accessed and used by authorized [and initiated] men in the community. If you are recognized as an authorized party you may access this material and share it with regard to the cultural and gendered conditions of access and use. If you are not from the community and you have accessed this material, the X community requests that you do not download, copy, remix or otherwise circulate this material to others. This material is not freely available within the community and it therefore should not be considered freely available outside the community. [If you have come across this material freely online, you may wish to contact the community directly to let them know of its existence beyond their community archive.]</p>
