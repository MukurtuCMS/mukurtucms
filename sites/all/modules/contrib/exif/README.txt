README file for the Exif Drupal module.


Description
***********

The Exif module allows to display Exif metadata on image nodes. Exif is a
specification for the image file format used by digital cameras.

The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum including [1]:

 * Date and time information. Digital cameras will record the current date and
   time and save this in the metadata.
 * Camera settings. This includes static information such as the camera model
   and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation,
   aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering mode, and film speed
   information.
 * Location information, which could come from a GPS receiver connected to the
   camera.
 * Descriptions and copyright information.

Administrators can choose via CCK fields which Exif information are read.

At this time, this module supports Exif information only with JPEG files.

Requirements
**************

CCK with at least textfields enabled.
Exif PHP Extension enabled.


Constraints
*************

Constraints with Image Processing utility :

Note that, it has been reported that when using GD, it strips some fields
(like field_gps_gpslatitude or field_gps_gpslongitude) from uploaded files.
Imagemagick seems not to have this limitation and does not strip these fields.
So Imagemagick is recommended when access to GPS data.

Usage
************

After installing it you can go to your CCK nodetype. It supports both the image module 
aswell as the imagefield module. Let's say you have an content type "photo". Go to your
cck settings and add a new field. For the name of the field you need to follow the following
naming conventions:

### Example:
#1 field_exif_exposuretime -> this would read the ExposureTime of the image and save it
in this field.

#2 field_ifd0_datetime ->	this would read the date time (2009:01:23 08:52:43) of the image.
as a field_type you can take for example a normal textfield, but also a date field would be
possible.

General rule is: [field]_[section]_[name] 

Under admin/settings/exif you can see a list of all possible information. These informations
are taken from the image "sample.jpg". I may not contain all tags available. If you are looking
for some specific tags you can just replace this image with your own image.
