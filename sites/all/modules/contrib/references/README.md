INTRODUCTION
------------

The References project contains straight ports of the node_reference and
user_reference modules to the Drupal 7 API.

For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
http://drupal.org/project/references


REQUIREMENTS
------------

No special requirements


INSTALLATION
------------

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further
information.

GOALS AND LIMITATIONS
---------------------
  
It is not envisioned as a final solution, but as a way to actually deploy 
Drupal 7 from release day on sites using node and user references much as on 
Drupal 6, until a native entity relationships Drupal 7 module becomes a usable 
alternative.

As of 2010-11-30, is looks like a candidate for that usable alternative might
someday be project Relation: 
  http://drupal.org/project/relation

In short: use these modules now, but be ready to migrate to a different entity
referencing solution during the D7 life cycle.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * There is no configuration.
