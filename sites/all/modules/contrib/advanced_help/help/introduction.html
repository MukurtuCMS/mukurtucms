<p>The <strong>Advanced Help</strong> module provides a framework that
allows help texts to be viewed as integrated into a Drupal
website.</p>

<p>These help texts are stored in ordinary <code>.html</code>-files
that lives in the file system (as opposed to the database).  These
files are distributed from the project Drupal.org repo in the same
package as the module or theme, and placed in a subdirectory named
<code>help</code> in the project or theme directory.</p>
  
<p>The help texts can be placed in an hierarchical book, allowing for
top-down navigation, or programmatically placed in popups that can be
added to a page with plain text links or themed icon links.</p>

<p>If there is a <code>README.md</code> or <code>README.txt</code> in
the package, the content of that file may be shown as well.</p>
  
<p>Cross-linking book-sections,using fragment identifiers, works as
one would expect.</p>

<p>The help texts may be made searchable, but are not so by default (see
“<a href="&topic:advanced_help/using-advanced-help#search&">Using advanced help</a>”
for details).  If search is enabled, all help texts are fully
indexed. This means that the entire contents of the advanced help set
of pages can be searched for keywords.</p>

<p>Modules and themes can even insert help texts into another
project's hierarchy.</p>

<p>May be integrated into <code>hook_help()</code> using companion
module
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/advanced_help_hint"><strong>Advanced Help Hint</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demonstration</h2>

<p>The project comes with a small demo module named
<strong>Advanced Help Example</strong> to demonstrate how it works.
This example also shows how to make use of some of the css classes
provided.</p>

<p>For an example of a project that makes extensive use of the
advanced help features, see the <strong>Views</strong> project.</p>

<p>For an example of translation of help text, see the
directory <code>translations/help/nb</code> in the <strong>Advanced
Help Example</strong> submodule. For translation instructions, see the
section named “<a href="&topic:advanced_help/translation&">Translating
advanced help</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="theme">Theme</h2>

<p>The <strong>Advanced Help</strong> and
<strong>Advanced Help Example</strong> modules implements
<code>hook_admin_paths_alter()</code> to render the help
texts rendered using the site's administrative theme.
The <code>help.css</code> provided is created with the
theme <strong>Seven</strong> in mind.  Using a different
administrative theme may require you to create custom css for the
site.</p>

<p>The contributed module
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_path"><strong>Administrative pages</strong></a>
seems to override <code>hook_admin_paths_alter()</code>.  If you use this module,
you also need to navigate to
<span class="nav">Configuration » User interface » Administrative pages</span>
and declare these paths as administrative pages:</p>

<pre>
help/advanced_help/*
help/help_example/*
</pre>

<p>You may attach your own custom css to any project that
uses <strong>Advanced Help</strong> to provide help.</p>
