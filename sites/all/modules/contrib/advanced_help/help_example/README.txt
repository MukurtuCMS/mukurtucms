Introduction
------------

This is a simple example demonstrating how to use Advanced help.

Requirements
------------

This module required Advanced help to be installed.

Installation
------------

Install the module as you would normally install a contributed Drupal
module. See
https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for
further information.

Configuration and use
---------------------

There is nothing to configure.

When you enable the module, the item “Example help” will show up in
the black administration toolbar. Click on the link, to see an example
of a help popup.

When you navigate to *Help » Advanced help » Advanced help example »
About help example*, you may see the help files as an hierarchical
manual.

When you disable the module, this goes away.
