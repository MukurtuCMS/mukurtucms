This module allows Mail Comment to act on messages sent by Message Notify.

By default, this module will NOT work on any message types. You must specifically allow it to work on each message type. To do this, edit a message type, and check the box that allows replies by email.

Note that this module assumes that messages for comments have a 'field_comment_ref' field, and messages for nodes have a 'field_node_ref' field.
