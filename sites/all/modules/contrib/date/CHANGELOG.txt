Date 7.x-2.0-rc1, 2011-12-20
----------------------------
The Date Browser has been removed. Please use the Date Pager instead. If you
have existing views using the Date Browser the navigation will just disappear
from them. If you add a Date Pager to the view you should get it back. Then
delete the Date Browser attachment from the view, since it doesn't do anything
any more.

The UNTIL date was not getting included in repeating results and that is now
fixed. This is an API change of sorts for anyone who worked around the issue by
setting it ahead.

The All Day checkbox and All Day themes were moved into a separate module, using
new hooks added to the date processing. This module should serve as an example
of how other modules can inject functionality into date fields.

A new module has been added for integrating the Date Repeat API into date
fields. Some of this code has been moved into the new module, more of it will be
moved later as I figure out how to unwind it from the base processing. An update
hook has been added to enable this module by default for existing sites. If you
don't use Repeating dates you can disable it.

New Features/Major Changes:
#1229378 by ksenzee: Sync the end date with the start date on new dates using
  select widgets.
#1236216 by KarenS: Move the repeating date integration out of the Date module
  and into a separate, Date Repeat Field module.
#874322 by KarenS: The All Day functionality has been moved into a separate
  module and hooks were added to make it easier for other modules to inject
  steps into date processing.
#1267046 by KarenS: Include the UNTIL date in repeating results.
#1354606 by temaruk: Rework the repeating date UI to make it more user-friendly.
#1362654 by KarenS: Remove Advanced Help integration, it needs a total rewrite.
#1357362 by KarenS: Remove Date Browser, use Date Pager instead.
#1354606 by KarenS: Make sure COUNT option without UNTIL date can be handled
  correctly by repeating date computations.

Bugfixes

  in the database timezone, not the display timezone.
#1245106 by Gábor Hojtsy, Hide the option to add the delta into the view for

  they still get set on hidden fields.


Date 7.x-2.0-alpha5, 2011-11-29
-------------------------------
The date repeat widgets have been removed to keep users from trying to change
repeating dates into non-repeating dates. There are now just three widgets, Date
Select, Date Text, and Date Popup. Whether or not a date is a repeating date is
now controlled by a field setting.

  of difference.
#1238660 by KarenS: Add custom format option for the date format used in summary

Date 7.x-2.0-alpha4, 2011-08-23
-------------------------------
Notes to themers:
Previous versions put dates with both From and To dates into a fieldset and
other dates were not. The new code adds additional floating elements that are
hard to contain, so now all dates are enclosed in fieldsets in the node form.
There are also new elements on the form, an optional checkbox for hiding/showing
the To date and an optional checkbox for hiding/showing time. Previously dates
on the node form had 'From date' and 'To date' labels above them, this has been
changed to remove those labels, using the Google calendar date entry screen as a
model. This simplifies the node form and dates take up less space. A light grey
border has been added around each collection of dates (the From date and the To
date). The display of labels above the date parts (year, month, day, date, time,
etc) is controlled in the field settings. Previous versions did not always honor
those settings, this one does.

  fields.
#1100934 by KarenS: Replace deprecated date_array() function.

Date 7.x-2.0-alpha1, 2011-03-09
-------------------------------
Start a new 7.x-2.x branch that will contain a complete re-work of the Views
handling.

The 7.x-2.x branch will totally re-work and simplify the Views filters. These
changes may/will break some views and will require that you check views that use
the date filter or argument to be sure they are still configured correctly.

There is a new date_filter_handler_simple for an individual date field that
simplifies the Views handling by using most of the core Views field handling but
adds in the possibility to set a default date using options like 'now', along
with a choice of a month/day/year drop-down selector or popup calendar selector.

The date_filter_handler is an extension of the simple handler that allows you to
combine multiple dates into a single filter so that you can control all of them
with the same filter widget, allowing you to either 'OR' or 'AND' them together.

The arguments will be rewritten in the same way, with a simple argument handler
for individual dates and another handler that extends that to control multiple
dates with a single argument.

#1082658 by KarenS: Saving the options as arrays breaks other things. Add a
  custom export plugin instead.
#1082658 by KarenS: Views options need to be declared as arrays or they are not
  saved in the export in Views 3.

  make a date out of a string to avoid showing the user errors.

  view.
