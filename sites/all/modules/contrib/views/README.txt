INTRODUCTION
------------

The Views module allows you to fetch content from the database and present it
to the user in a number of ways (lists, posts, maps, graphs, galleries, tables,
menu items, blocks, reports, forum posts, and so on).

Views provides a graphical interface to an SQL query builder that can access
virtually any information in your database, and then display it in any format.

You can also use Views to present related content. For example, you can
display a list of users along with links to the content they have created.

NOTE: Some of the advanced features require additional modules to be installed.
