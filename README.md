### <a name="availability"></a>Availability

#### <a name="vendor-hosted"></a> Vendor Hosted
Most commercial web hosting companies will be able to host a Mukurtu CMS site. Look for support for Drupal 7. Reclaim Hosting (http://reclaimhosting.com) has a simple one-step install option for Mukurtu CMS.

#### <a name="self-hosted"></a>Self-Hosted
Mukurtu CMS is available as an open source distribution through https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms to run on a local server or install on your preferred web platform.

##### <a name="system-requirements"></a>System Requirements
Mukurtu CMS is built using Drupal 7 and has all of the same [minimum system requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements). This includes:
* A web server with PHP support, such as Apache or nginx.
* [PHP](http://www.php.net/) version 7.4 or 8.0/8.1. Note: If using PHP 8, it is recommended to disable deprecation warnings in `error_reporting`.
* A database server such as [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDb](https://mariadb.org/)

##### <a name="installation"></a>Installation
Mukurtu CMS is built on Drupal 7 and can be installed in exactly the same way. Drupal 7 is included with Mukurtu CMS, it is not necessary to download and install Drupal 7 separately. Instructions on how to install Drupal 7 for in your environment are directly applicable to installing Mukurtu CMS, simply download the Mukurtu CMS code repository in place of Drupal 7. More detailed installation information can be found in INSTALL.txt in the same directory as this document or online at [Installing Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install). It is highly recommended to use git to download Mukurtu CMS rather than downloading files directly (e.g., the zip package). It will make the process of updating the application files much easier in the future.

##### Configuration and Post-installation Steps
* Review the recommended settings for PHP and more [here](https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms/wiki/Quick-Installation-Information-for-Experienced-Drupal-Admins).
* Configure the Drupal private file path. This is critical. Cultural protocols will not function as expected if you skip this step. You can read the official [information about the Drupal private path](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/core/modules/file/overview). The basic steps are as follows.
  * Create a new directory, ideally outside of your web root, for private files to be stored. This will be where your users' uploaded media and files will reside.
  * The web server user will need read and write access to this directory.
  * Edit `sites/default/settings.php` and add the path of your new private files directory to the `file_private_path` setting. If you do not yet have a `settings.php` file, you can copy and rename `default.settings.php` to use as a starting point.
* Set the 'database', 'username', and 'password' values to match your database configuration.
* Once your site is installed, configure cron at `/admin/config/system/cron`.

##### <a name="upgrading"></a>Upgrading

If you are using a vendor hosted solution (such as Reclaim Hosting), check their support documentation before upgrading. Some vendors provide automated Mukurtu CMS upgrades via the control panel.

If you are self-hosting Mukurtu CMS, it is best to update the application files using git. Updates to Drupal 7 and contributed modules are included in each Mukurtu CMS release, and in general you should not attempt to update individual modules yourself outside of official Mukurtu releases. Update steps can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms/blob/master/VERSION.md), but in general upgrades should be done as follows:

* In a terminal, navigate to the directory you have Mukurtu CMS installed at.
* Retrieve the most recent files using git.
```
git pull
```
* Run any database updates. You can use drush for this. Installation instructions for drush can be found at http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/. You can also do this step via the web interface by visiting `/update.php` on your site. Repeat this step until there are no more database upgrades available.
 ```
 drush updb -y
 ```
* Some updates will require you to revert some or all features. Features package Mukurtu CMS specific configuration as code for distribution. Reverting a feature will reset it to match the current Mukurtu CMS configuration. Check each version's release notes for specific notes on which features need to be reverted, but as an example here is how you could revert all features:
```
drush fra -y
```
* Aspects of some releases may not take effect until you clear the caches. Note that a full cache clear can cause temporary performance issues on larger sites as the cache is rebuilt.
```
drush cc all
```


### <a name="ddev"></a>Local Testing & Evaluation using DDEV
Mukurtu CMS can be installed locally using [DDEV](https://ddev.com/).
* Download and install [DDEV](https://github.com/drud/ddev), following the instructions for your operating system.
* Open a terminal and clone the Mukurtu CMS repository to a new directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms.git my-mukurtu-site
```
* Change into that directory, replacing 'my-mukurtu-site' with whatever you used in the above step.
```
cd my-mukurtu-site
```
* Initialize the ddev project. Follow the prompts for Drupal 7 and use the current directory as the docroot.
```
ddev config
```
* Start ddev:
```
ddev start
```
* Launch your new ddev project:
```
ddev launch
```
* You should now see the Mukurtu CMS installer, ready for you to use. Follow the form's instructions.
* When you are done, you can stop the ddev instance with:
```
ddev stop
```
